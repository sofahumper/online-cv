    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Hey, I’m Leo, and I am a UL 508A Certified MTR/Ignition Credentialed 
      Integrator with experience in Packaging, Water treatment, Chemical Production,
      Concrete Batching, and General Automation Industry based in Montreal, Canada.
      I have experience working as both a traveling and an in-house controls 
      specialist. I started off my career by working as an independent contractor
      where I progressed from an automation/instrumentation tech replacing various
      sensors and devices to doing turnkey projects from scratch (Project management,
      Sales, Logistics, Drafting with AutoCAD, Programming, and Installation). At 
      Scale-Tron I filled many roles from IT/Sysadmin for the company to R&D and 
      Project Management. At Sidel is where I honed my integration and programming
      skills on many different platforms and discovered that I don’t mind traveling
      for work when I stayed in Los Angeles at the Anheuser-Busch factory for 70 days straight.
